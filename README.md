# WeatherAnomalyDetectionClassification
This repository holds the scripts and reports for a project on time series anomaly detection, time series classification & dynamic time warping, performed on a dataset of Canadian weather measurements. The data was sourced from [OpenML](https://openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=43843&sort=runs), shared by user Elif Ceren GÃ¶k.

## Time series anomaly detection
Multivariate time series anomaly detection using [PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod) algorithms & the [Darts](https://github.com/unit8co/darts) package: K-means clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models, ECOD, Isolation Forest and an Autoencoder with PyTorchLightning. Visualizing & comparing the results with multiple plots, including 3D interactive Plotly scatterplots.
